# CirclePacking

This application is meant to allow for manipulations of Circle Packings using a space of packing algorithms.

Installation
------------
Download Processing 3 from https://processing.org/. Open main.pde, and click the play button.

Control
-------
Click to add new points and drag to set the radii.

Use the right and left arrow keys to employ different heuristics to move towards a circle packing.

Use the 'm' key to turn on Mobius transformations.  Then, drag with a right click to apply the transformations.

Use the 'k' key to visualize the Koebe polyhedron and the packing on the sphere.
