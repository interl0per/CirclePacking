# CirclePacking

This application is meant to allow for manipulations of Circle Packings using a space of packing algorithms.

Installation
------------
Download Processing 3 from https://processing.org/. Open main.pde, and click the play button.

Control
-------
Click to add new points and drag to set the radii.

Use the right and left arrow keys to employ different heuristics to move towards a circle packing.

Use the 'spacebar' to cycle through representations of the circle packing. Including the dual packing, the space of mobius transformations and the sterographic projection onto the sphere. In the latter two views, drag the mouse to apply the mobius transformations/rotate the sphere.

Use the 'c' key to clear the visualization space.
