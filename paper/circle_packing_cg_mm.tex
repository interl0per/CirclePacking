\section{Interactive Input} % (fold)
\label{sec:interactive_input}

  One immediate challenge to working interactively with circle packings is the need for input triangulations.
  We would like to be able to produce triangulations with a minimum of effort.  
  The most natural approach is to draw circles and produce the weighted Delaunay triangulation of the circles.
  This is the dual to the so-called power diagram, a Voronoi diagram on the points where the (squared) distance to a circle $c$ with center $p$ and radius $r$ is defined to be
  \[
    \pi_c(x)^2 := \|x-p\|^2 - r^2.
  \]
  
  Weighted Delaunay triangulations have another interpretation as projections of convex polyhedra in $\R^3$

  Drop weighted points and build the weighted Delaunay triangulation incrementally
  (advantage: you can draw an approximate packing)
  
  Mobius Transformations
  Stereographic Maps?
  Parabolic Lifting?
