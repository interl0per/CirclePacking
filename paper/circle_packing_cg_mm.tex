\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}

  The Koebe Embedding Theorem provides a wonderful link between questions of geometry, topology, combinatorics, and complex analysis.
  It states that every planar graph can be realized as the intersection graph of a collection of interior disjoint circles in the plane.
  That is, the vertices correspond to circles and two circles are tangent if and only if their corresponding vertices share an edge.
  Such a graph representation is called a circle packing.
  They have found application in computational geometry such as in a proof of the planar separator theorem~\cite{miller97separators} or for bounding eigenvectors of graph Laplacians~\cite{kelner06spectral}.
  
  Technically, circle packings exist for any planar graph, but it is often simpler algorithmically to work with $3$-connected, triangulated planar graphs and we will assume such graph throughout.
  There are several known algorithms for computing a circle packing from a given planar graph.
  Early proofs of the existence of circle packings were non-constructive, but the work of Colin de Verdiere\cite{colindeverdiere91principe} and others~\cite{mohar93polynomial,bobenko03variational} showed that circle packings can be computed by convex optimization, ushering in several different iterative algorithms.
  A good introduction to the mathematical and algorithmic aspects of circle packings can be found in the book by Stephenson~\cite{stephenson05introduction}.
  
  As shown in the work of Bobenko and Sprinborn, there are several different energy functionals that one could minimize to arrive at a circle packing~\cite{bobenko03variational}.
  However, there are simple heuristics that are not known to give correct algorithms, yet still seems too produce good circle packings. 
  We present a tool designed to make it easy to mix and match circle packing heuristics. 
  One can quickly generate a triangulated planar graph and then apply different heuristics to move it towards a circle packing representation.

\section{Background} % (fold)
\label{sec:background}

  Circle packings are closely related to several other well-known topics in computational geometry.
  The most notable, being weighted Delaunay triangulations.  
  
  Tutte's Algorithm
  Maxwell's Theorem
  Weighted Delaunay
  Dual Packings

\section{Interactive Input} % (fold)
\label{sec:interactive_input}

  One immediate challenge to working interactively with circle packings is the need for input triangulations.
  We would like to be able to produce triangulations with a minimum of effort.  
  The most natural approach is to draw circles and produce the weighted Delaunay triangulation of the circles.
  This is the dual to the so-called power diagram, a Voronoi diagram on the points where the (squared) distance to a circle $c$ with center $p$ and radius $r$ is defined to be
  \[
    \pi_c(x)^2 := \|x-p\|^2 - r^2.
  \]
  
  Weighted Delaunay triangulations have another interpretation as projections of convex polyhedra in $\R^3$.

  Drop weighted points and build the weighted Delaunay triangulation incrementally
  (advantage: you can draw an approximate packing)
  
  Mobius Transformations
  Stereographic Maps?
  Parabolic Lifting?
